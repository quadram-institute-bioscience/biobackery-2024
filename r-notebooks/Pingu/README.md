# PINGU

ðŸ“‘ [PINGU R Markdown](HOp1_Metaphlan4.Rmd)

This hands-on tutorial focuses on the application of **Metaphlan4** for microbiome analysis,
using the PINGU dataset.

We will sum the counts of a sample and investigate discrepancies in expected figures.
The tutorial then covers:

* parsing the Metaphlan4 output to create a data container for the **Mia** package,
* followed by an alpha-diversity analysis,
* including plotting species richness and the Shannon index.


Further, it involves community composition analysis, visualizing relative abundances by infant age group,
and performing unsupervised ordination using PCoA with Bray-Curtis distances.
